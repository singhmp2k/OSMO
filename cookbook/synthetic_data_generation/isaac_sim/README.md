# Isaac Sim: Generating Synthetic Data

## Overview

This workflow uses Isaac Sim, a robotics simulator, to generate synthetic data that can be used to train deep neural
networks. The workflow consists of one main task that launches Isaac Sim, and generates 60 images.

## Prerequisites

- Access to an OSMO cluster with GPU resources

## Running this workflow

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/OSMO/main/cookbook/synthetic_data_generation/isaac_sim/isaac_sim_sdg.yaml
osmo workflow submit isaac_sim_sdg.yaml
```
