Agent Skill
===========

OSMO provides an agent skill that enables AI agents to interact with the OSMO CLI on your behalf.
Once installed, agents in tools such as Claude Code, Cursor and Codex can check GPU resources,
generate and submit workflows, monitor progress, diagnose failures, and orchestrate end-to-end
Physical AI workloads through natural language.

The skill follows the `Agent Skills <https://agentskills.io>`_ open standard and is compatible with
`30+ agent tools <https://skills.sh/>`_.

To install:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ npx skills add NVIDIA/osmo

.. seealso::

   See the `skills/README <https://github.com/NVIDIA/osmo/tree/main/skills>`_ for detailed
   installation options and usage examples.
